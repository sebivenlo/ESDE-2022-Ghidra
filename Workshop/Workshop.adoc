== ESDE Workshop
 

Ghidra is a powerful software reverse engineering framework that can be used to analyze and understand the inner workings of software programs. It was originally developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and was later released to the public as open-source software. 

toc::[]

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Ghidra and provide step-by-step instructions for using it to reverse engineer a simple program. 

  

Installation: (If you already have installed Ghidra you can skip this step) 

To get started with Ghidra, you first need to download and install it on your computer. Ghidra is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and can be downloaded from the official website at https://ghidra-sre.org/. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website to install Ghidra on your system. 

  

=== Creating a New Project:

Once Ghidra is installed, you can create a new project by launching Ghidra and selecting "File"> "New Project" from the menu. Give your project a name and select a directory to save it in. 

  

=== Basic code analysis: 

When a program first opens in tool, it automatically kicks off auto-analysis and asks the user for confirmation to start analyzing the program you have loaded. 

The main goal of auto analyzing is creating cross referencing, creating functions at called locations and disassembling the program following flows. With the help of some options, you can make auto analysis, also help with making switch statements and Demange mangled names and perform specific functions depending on binary type to name a few. But these functions can better be done later, and it is best to start with only the basic options. 

 
=== Selections and highlights: 

Selections are temporary and have a green glow to them when selected, you can create them manually and created using the select menu. When searching for something you get an automatically selected part which you searched for when found. 

Highlights, however, are semi-permanent and do not go away until user clears using menu. 

 

 

=== Importing a Program 

With your project created, you can now import the program that you want to reverse engineer. Select "File"> "Import File" from the menu and select the executable file of the program you want to analyze. Ghidra will automatically analyze the program and create a new program database (PDB) file. 

  

=== Analyzing the Program 

Once the program is imported, you can start analyzing it in Ghidra. The main interface of Ghidra is divided into several windows, including the CodeBrowser, the Symbol Tree, and the Listing window. The CodeBrowser is the main window that shows the program's disassembled code. 

  

To analyze the program, you can start by exploring the CodeBrowser and examining the distinct functions and instructions of the program. You can also use the Symbol Tree to navigate the different symbols and functions of the program. 

  

=== Decompiling the Program 

One of the most powerful features of Ghidra is its ability to decompile the program code into C code. To decompile a function, simply double-click on the function in the CodeBrowser, and select "Decompile" from the context menu. 

  

The decompiled code can be used to better understand the program's functionality and to help identify vulnerabilities or security issues. 

  

=== Debugging the Program 

Another useful feature of Ghidra is its ability to debug the program. To start debugging, select "Debugger"> "Attach to Process" from the menu, and select the process that you want to debug. 

  

Once attached, you can use the Debugger window to set breakpoints, step through the code, and examine the memory and registers of the program. 

  

=== Conclusion 

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of Ghidra and provided step-by-step instructions for using it to reverse engineer a simple program. While Ghidra can be a complex tool, it is also incredibly powerful and can be used to analyze and understand the inner workings of even the most complex software programs. With some practice, you can become proficient in using Ghidra to reverse engineer programs and identify vulnerabilities and security issues. 

 
 
== Exercises 
Next are going to be some exercises to do along with the instructions to familiarize yourself with Ghidra and get to know some basic functionality which you will use to complete the assignment lateron.

=== Exercise: 

.exercise code
----
[source,C]
// @author Sjong Leow {@code s.leow@student.fontys.nl} 

int main() 
{    
	char name[100]; 

    	int age; 

    	askName(name); 

    	askAge(&age); 

     	printf("Your name is %s and you are %d years old.\n", name, age); 

    	return 0; 

}  

void askName(char name[]) 
{   printf("What is your name? "); 

    scanf("%s", name); 

} 

 void askAge(int *age) 
{    printf("What is your age? "); 

    scanf("%d", age); 

} 
----
Save this program as a file called program.c. 

  

* Open Ghidra: 

Once you've downloaded and installed Ghidra, open the program. 

  

* Create a new project: 

When you first open Ghidra, you'll be prompted to create a new project. Give your project a name and select a location to save it. 

Convert to a.out or a.exe 

Go to where you saved your program.c use a C compiler such as GCC or Clang to convert to a.out or a.exe. If you don’t have it installed, you can use this in the terminal to install  GCC sudo apt install GCC 

 

* Import the program:  

In the Ghidra project window, right-click on "Programs" and select "Import file." Navigate to the location of your program.c file and select it. 

  

* Analyze the program:  

Once your program is imported, right-click on it and select "Analyze." Ghidra will analyze the program and create a "Program Tree" on the left-hand side of the screen. 

  

* Explore the program:  

	You can now explore the program using the "Program Tree" and the different views in Ghidra. For example, you can view the program's code in the "Listing" view, which shows the assembly code for the program. 

  

* Disassemble the program:  

	Let's disassemble the program to see its assembly code. In the "Program Tree," expand the "Functions" section and find the main function. Double-click on the function to open it in the "Listing" view. 

  

* Analyze the disassembled code:  

In the "Listing" view, you can see the assembly code for the main function. You can use the assembly code to better understand how the program works. 

  

* Find the printf function:  

Let's find the printf function in the program. In the "Program Tree," expand the "Symbols" section and find the symbol that represents the printf function. Double-click on the symbol to open it in the "Listing" view. 

  

* Analyze the printf function:  

In the "Listing" view, you can see the assembly code for the printf function. You can use the assembly code to better understand how the printf function works. 

  

* Find the user input functions:  

Let's find the scanf functions that read in the user's name and age. In the "Program Tree," expand the "Functions" section and find the main function. Right-click on the function and select "Find references." In the "Find References" window, search for scanf. 

  

* Analyze the user input functions:  

Ghidra will show you all the places in the program where the scanf functions are used to read in user input. You can use this information to better understand how the user input is processed. 

  

* Save your work:  

Once you've analyzed the program to your satisfaction, make sure to save your Ghidra project so you can return to it later if needed. 

 
=== Basic functionality of ghidra:

The next set of instructions is to try and understand the basic functionality of Ghidra.


* Highlighting

When you click on a piece of code in the listing or in the decompile window you see it gets selected on the other window aswell: 

.Highlight example
image::Highlighted.png[]

* Labels

To make the code more readable, you can use labels or renaming the variables to make it easier to read. 

This is done by clicking on the word in the decompiler and pressing L or right click and rename variable. 

.Variable example
image::Labels.png[]

 
* Convert 
when you want to view numbers in a diffrent type like an unsigned decimal instead of Hex numbers that are in the listing view
you select the line where you want the convert to happen and right click and convert.

.Convert example
image::Convert.png[]

* Bookmarks 
for the possibility to easily navigate between functions/methods of interest where you can create multiple bookmarks and switch between them.

.Bookmarks example
image::Bookmark.png[]

* Search 
when you want to search for a specific string in the project to be able to jump to the position of this string to get more knowledge about how the application works.

.Search example

next is the main assignment of the workshop:

=== Practice into Action CrackMe1 Assignment

Go into the Assignment folder

Open the .jar file in ghidra using the import file function and look for the password. And look around for what you can find. 

If the jar does not run when you double, click on it then you can use this command: java -jar jarfilename.jar 



Good luck! 

~ Hints

Use the "Functions" window to list all functions in the program.

Use the "Disassembly" window to view the assembly code of the program.

Use the "Strings" window to locate Strings in memory. 

For example “Hello world” or other things that are relevant in the project or exercise like “Password” or “User name”.
